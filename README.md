With [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/stylish/) or [superUserContent](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/superusercontent/) for Firefox, you can replace the default CSS on websites you visit.

*Stylish* also allows you to modify Firefox's interface. *superUserContent* doesn't support this yet but you can modify `.mozilla/chrome/userChrome.css` directly instead.
